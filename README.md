📚 BookMate
Your Companion for Growth Beyond the Page
Built with purpose by Team BitByBit

✨ What is BookMate?
BookMate isn’t just a learning tool. It’s your personal guide to explore beyond the boundaries of what you know, helping you take actionable steps in the real world — inspired by the knowledge you consume.

In an age of passive learning, BookMate asks:

What if reading was just the beginning?

We believe that experience > theory — and BookMate helps users turn ideas into action by combining reading, reflection, and real-world challenges.

🎯 Our Goal
As freshers entering our first hackathon, we wanted to build something that reflects our own journey:
Pushing past our comfort zone, exploring the unknown, and learning by doing.

BookMate is designed to help others do the same—bit by bit.

💡 Key Features
📖 Reading-Driven Challenges – Every book recommendation comes with curated real-world tasks

🎯 Personal Growth Tracker – See how far you’ve gone outside your comfort zone

🧠 Explore by Category – Learn socially, creatively, emotionally, and technically

🏅 Gamified Progression – Earn badges and build streaks as you act on what you learn

👥 Community Feed (Coming Soon) – See how others are growing beyond the page

⚙️ Tech Stack
Frontend – React.js + TailwindCSS

Backend – Firebase (Auth, Firestore)

💬 Final Thought
BookMate is more than a project. It’s a mindset:

“Read. Reflect. Act. Grow.”

We believe real growth starts when knowledge meets experience—and we built BookMate to help people take that first step.
